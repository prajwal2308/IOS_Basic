## App Brainstorming 


list of your favorite 3 applications with 2-3 features that make them my favorite app.
- [ ] App1: Gmail
Switching between multiple Gmail accounts made simpler just by scrolling up or down on the right corner profile Image.
Swipe left or right on mail list either deletes the mail or archieve that particular mail.
Additionally switching between email can be done by swiping left or right.

- [ ] App2: Instacart
Its an e-commerce of e-commerce application
I like the feature implementation where it displays multiple store prices and availability option at one place
Search store and filters all the items only from that particular store
Integrated shopping list allows you to see each individual items from different stores

- [ ] App3: Whatsapp
Archieving unimportant chats to avoid distractions
Message can be sent to self number.


My Idea of Implementing a new app
Problem Statement: These days there are lot of problem students and people facing around is loneliness. People like introvert or scared of meeting new people would be beneficial with this application to make them bond with fellow stranger and give an emotional support when they are lonely.
Idea: Its an application that lets you know strangers plans around you. For example, I have booked a movie ticket alone, But I need someone to accompany new or join me. I post this status on the application. If unknown have the same plan then might be they can catch up together. This might be based on accepting or declining option for both the user ends. We do allow users to keep their mobile location on until the duration for protection if they needed. 
Additional another part of application is a type of GPT that is truely based on human response during emotional situation. I am depressed, I have no other person close enough to share my feeling, This GPT might help you ease your pain by replying to your text the same way human does. Existing GPT doesnt hold humanoized reply for these kind of emotional situation, This model might be on upperhand in these situations.



## Notes

As I am new to this Xcode interface it did take some time figuring out the necessary utilities required. But ideally as more projects are built, I guess it might be easier to work on.
