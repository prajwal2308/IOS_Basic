## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
At the bottom of your README, add a section called App Brainstorming. In this section, you will add the following:

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
Example App: Instagram
Changing the background color of the messages screen
Deleting old messages
 Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.


## Notes

As I am new to this Xcode interface it did take some time figuring out the necessary utilities required. But ideally as more projects are built, I guess it might be easier to work on.
